Marielle Franco (Marielle Francisco da Silva) was a sociologist and politician who defended feminism, human rights and criticized federal intervention and the military police. She was born in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) on July 27, 1979. She joined the community pre-university entrance exam and graduated in sociology at PUC (Pontifical Catholic University) and received a master's degree in public administration from UFF (Federal Fluminense University).

The activist was a councilor in PSOL (Partido Socialismo e Liberdade), elected in 2017 and provided services in civil organizations such as CEASM (Center for Solidarity Actions of Maré) and the Brazil Foundation; She was also coordinator of the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights and Citizenship at ALERJ (Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro). She was viewed internationally by NGOs (International Amnesty, for example), by draft laws and topics in favor of the rights of the LGBTQ + community, people from the favela (shanty towns) and black people.

March 14, 2018 was the day of her murder. She left her daughter, Luyara Santos, her wife, Mônica Benício, her mother, Marinete da Silva and her sister, Anielle Franco. She was returning from a lecture on feminism, awareness of black culture and representation at Estácio (neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro). The driver of her car, Anderson Pedro Gomes, also died.

Marielle Franco's last pronouncement before being executed in Rio de Janeiro: "I will not be interrupted! I do not endure interruption by the councilors of this house! I will not take it from a citizen who comes here and does not know how to listen to the position of an elected woman!"

If she were alive now, she would be the only black woman among 51 councilors in Rio de Janeiro. "How many more are going to need to die for this war to end?" Marielle Franco published on Twitter, on March 13, 2018, the day before she was murdered, about Matheus Melo (a young man killed by the military police while leaving the church).

Political allies (such as Marcelo Freixo of PSOL) and journalists continue to charge and pressure investigators for answers. The British newspaper "The Guardian'' praised Marielle's visibility and relevance as a spokesperson for the underprivileged population. "Le Monde", a French newspaper, highlights Marielle's walk against police brutality, racism and homophobia. The Arab network "Al Jazeera" asks "quem matou Marielle?" (who killed Marielle?) and "quem mandou matar Marielle?" (who had Marielle killed?) they are, then, national marks in justice for black people, mainly women. "The New York Times" called the crime a 'blatant political murder'.

Marielle was extremely critical of police brutality against minorities (black people, people from the favela (shanty towns) and LGBTQ +). Today, she has an institute (Instituto Marielle Franco), founded by the family, to keep her memorable history among us. "When a fighting woman dies, we all die a little with her"; "Cycle of a racist society: the more a young black and poor man is killed for existing, the more a black and poor mother suffers from loneliness"; "Resistance roses are born on the asphalt. We receive roses, but we will be with a clenched fist talking about our existence against the mandates and misdemeanors that affect our lives". Marielle is the hero that opened doors for other black women from shanty towns to express themselves, she ran so they could walk, Marielle present, today and always!

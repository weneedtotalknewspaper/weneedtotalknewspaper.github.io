Author's Note:
In all fifteen years of my life, I have understood from books, music and a lot of my role-models (including my mom and dad), how important mental health is. But unfortunately, it is far too often overlooked even in modern society. I have seen some of my friends struggle too. I wrote this poem dedicating it to them and to those who are having a hard time, for any reason, big or small.

I wish to let them know that they are not alone. I want them to know that their emotions are valid and that it's okay to feel this way.

To anyone struggling: I can't say anything from experience, but I can say that this will not last forever. Just hold on for a little longer, I promise it gets better.

Terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers in New York City are still remembered 20 years later.

On Sept. 11, 2001, four airplanes were hijacked and crashed into the North and South Towers, more commonly known as the Twin Towers, and the Pentagon.

A flight attendant on board one of the four planes hijacked saidin a phone call to American's office in Boston, "Something is wrong. We are in a rapid descent. We are flying way too low. Oh my God, we are way too low."

Soon after that call was made, that airplane collided with the World Trade Center's North Tower causing it to collapse. Shortly after the same happened to the South Tower.

That day left 2,977 people killed as a cause of the terrorist attacks. Even 20 years later, of Sept. 11, 2001 causes people to feel overwhelmed with sadness and fear from the attacks and the loved ones lost in the midst of it all.

According to the Pew Research Center, 92% of Americans felt sad watching news coverage of the 9/11 attacks and another 77% of Americans reported feeling frightened watching the media of the attacks. Additionally, three weeks after the attacks, 87% said they felt angry about the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

Politically, 9/11 left Americans with a new set of priorities.Two months after the attacks, 83% of Americans said “defending the country from future terrorist attacks” was a top priority for the United States, and was the number one priority over all.

Today, a 9/11 museum and memorial is put in place where the Twin Towers once sat. The museum and memorial are used to honor the lives lost that day and for others to learn the history of 9/11. Inside the 9/11 memorial is material evidence of the destruction from the attacks and the actions of people after the attacks.

For example, inside the museum can be found a smoldered fire truck with its hood almost completely blown off from the conditions caused by the airplanes crashing into the towers. Additionally, an original steel beam, adorned with memoranda of lost ones and missing posters of those following the attacks from the World Trade Center is displayed..

The 9/11 museum also holds an exhibit telling the story of how the hijackers of the planes that crashed into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon were found and how Americans reacted to the news of the lead hijacker being killed almost ten years later.

In modern day, most Americans under the age of 25 do not remember where they were or the day of 9/11 to its full extent. However, the mass amount of people affected by acts of terrorism on that day is a feeling that can not be forgotten. As per Pew Research, “In many ways, 9/11 reshaped how Americans think of war and peace, their own personal safety and their fellow citizens.”
